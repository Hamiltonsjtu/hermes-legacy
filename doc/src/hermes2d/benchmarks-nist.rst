Benchmarks (12 Problems from NIST Report NISTIR 7668)
=====================================================

This section contains a dozen benchmark problems with known exact solutions 
from Bill Mitchell's  
`NIST report 7668 <http://math.nist.gov/~WMitchell/papers/easpaper.pdf>`_.
The benchmarks are all "simple" elliptic equations in simple 
geometries that exhibit various difficulties that pose 
challanges to adaptive algorithms.
